# 1. Introduction

New York City operates on an immense scale, like millions of residents who depend daily on public services which keeps the city running. With such a complex infrastructure mistakes are bound to happen. The **311 service request system** serves as the city’s non-emergency channel, capturing how residents experience and report those issues. Each ticket, call, or update represents a snapshot of the city’s response in real time.

The motivation for this project came from simple question: *What can 311 data reveal about how New Yorkers interact with their city?* We aimed to discover patterns in complaint behavior, agency response, identifying which issues dominate, how quickly they are resolved, and where lack of efficiency is there across boroughs and complaint types.  

Few guiding questions shaped our exploration:
1. **What are New Yorkers worried about?**  
   How do the types of complaints differ by **location** (e.g., borough, location type) and by **reporting channel** (phone, online, mobile)?

2. **How do complaints get handled from start to finish?**  
   What does the journey look like from the time a complaint is created until it is closed, and how do status and resolution patterns vary across complaint types and agencies?

3. **How busy is the system, and where are the main slowdowns?**  
   When is the 311 system under the most pressure, and how do backlog and resolution times reveal operational bottlenecks?

Using raw data from the **NYC Open Data Portal**, we started with:

- **Data cleaning and standardization:** corrected invalid timestamps, merged redundant categories, and ensured consistency across key fields.  
- **Feature engineering:** created measures like complaint bucket, resolution time and service age to quantify responses.  
- **Geospatial enrichment:** integrated boroughs, neighborhoods, and agencies to study spatial variation.  
- **System exploration:** we filed a sample *noise complaint* ourselves to observe how user inputs and follow-up actions in the 311 system are recorded as structured fields in the dataset.

Through this process, our analysis started from raw records into a clear picture of 311 service interaction. It highlights how most requests are handled promptly while certain complaint categories show persistent delays demonstrating how open data can transform everyday service calls into measurable insights on life in New York City.
