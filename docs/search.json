    "text": "We choose Cleveland dot plot because with ~10 complaint buckets and 5 boroughs, a standard grouped bar chart would be wide and cluttered.\n\nA dot plot puts all categories on a shared horizontal scale (0–30%), which makes it easier to compare both within a borough and across boroughs.\n\n\n\nIn every borough, Noise Related and Vehicle and Parking are among the top categories by share, often together making up roughly one-third of complaints.\n\nManhattan is particularly noise-heavy, which matches expectations for a dense, mixed-use borough with late-night activity.\nStaten Island shows relatively more Street and Traffic Conditions and Vehicle and Parking complaints, consistent with a more car-reliant area.\n\nBuckets like Pests and Animals or Utilities and Power appear as small but visible shares everywhere; the dot plot keeps them from disappearing into an “Other” bucket. ## To quantify how “caught up” the city is, we approximated a daily backlog:\n\n\nbacklog(date) ≈ cumulative complaints created − cumulative complaints closed.",

Each bar is a column, ordered from most to least missing, and the color scale encodes the missingness rate.\nKey observations: - Several columns have almost complete missingness (≈ 95–100%), including\ntaxi_company_borough, road_ramp, bridge_highway_direction, bridge_highway_name,\nbridge_highway_segment, and taxi_pick_up_location. - Many of these fields are highly specialized (e.g., taxi or bridge/highway metadata) that apply only to a very small subset of 311 requests. - A second tier of columns (e.g., intersection_street_1, intersection_street_2, cross_street_1, cross_street_2) has moderate missingness (roughly 25–40%), typically for records where complaints do not occur at an intersection. We decided to remove extreme missingness columns from final dataframe, which will add noise and complexity without contributing to the main objective of the project and columns with moderate missingness but high potential value were kept for further analysis.\nHeatmap of Missing Data (Sampled Rows)\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(42)\nsampled_data &lt;- combined[sample(1:nrow(combined), 5000), ]\n\nmissing_long &lt;- as.data.frame(is.na(sampled_data)) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = \"Column\", values_to = \"IsMissing\")\n\nmissing_long &lt;- cbind(RowIndex = rep(1:nrow(sampled_data), times = ncol(sampled_data)), missing_long)\n\n# Plotting heatmap of missing data\nggplot(missing_long, aes(x = Column, y = RowIndex, fill = IsMissing)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"FALSE\" = \"white\", \"TRUE\" = \"red\"), name = \"Missing\") +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Missing Data (Sampled Rows)\",\n       x = \"Columns\",\n       y = \"Row Index\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo complement the summary bar chart, we also visualized missingness row by row for a random sample of records. In this heatmap: - Some columns form solid vertical red bands, meaning they are missing for almost all rows which correspond to the heavily missing taxi/bridge fields seen in the previous plot. - Other columns show stripe-like patterns, where only some rows are missing (e.g., closed_date for still-open complaints). - Core analytical fields such as created_date, complaint_type, and borough appear almost entirely white, confirming that they are reliable.",
