would be wide and cluttered.\n\nA dot plot puts all categories on a shared horizontal scale (0–30%), which makes it easier to compare both within a borough and across boroughs.\n\nWhat stands out\n\nIn every borough, Noise Related and Vehicle and Parking are among the top categories by share, often together making up roughly one-third of complaints.\n\nManhattan is particularly noise-heavy, which matches expectations for a dense, mixed-use borough with late-night activity.\nStaten Island shows relatively more Street and Traffic Conditions and Vehicle and Parking complaints, consistent with a more car-reliant area.\n\nBuckets like Pests and Animals or Utilities and Power appear as small but visible shares everywhere; the dot plot keeps them from disappearing into an “Other” bucket.",

The backlog plot is our main evidence that the 311 system is under sustained pressure rather than just dealing with a one-off spike.",

    "text": "Main Takeaways: 311 complaints in NYC exhibit distinct patterns in terms of types, resolution times, and geographic distribution. Key complaint categories such as noise, sanitation, and infrastructure dominate the dataset, with significant variations in how quickly different types are addressed. The analysis highlights that certain complaint types tend to remain open longer, indicating potential areas for process improvement.\nLimitations: Our analysis focuses on data from a specific timeframe (2023-2024) and may not capture seasonal or long-term trends. Additionally, the dataset relies on self-reported complaints, which affects the quality and completeness of the information.\nFuture Directions: Capture 5 years of data to analyze trends over time. Incoporate population density and demographic data to understand complaint patterns better.\nLessons Learned: Data cleaning and preprocessing are critical for accurate analysis, especially with large, real-world datasets. Geospatial enrichment adds valuable context to urban data, enhancing interpretability.",
