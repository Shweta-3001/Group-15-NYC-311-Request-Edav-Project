## Results

This section walks through what we actually **see** in the 311 data.  
Instead of repeating every statistic, we use a small set of plots where each one is meant
to answer a specific question. For each figure, we describe:

- the main pattern in plain language  
- why that chart type was a good fit  
- what it suggests about how the 311 system is working.

## Which complaint types are most common in NYC?
There were a unique total of 300 complaint types reported in the dataset. 
The complaint were bucketed into the following categories for better analysis:
Noise Related, Heat/Water/Gas Issues, Buildings and Housing, Sanitation and Waste, Street and Traffic Conditions, Public Safety / Crime / Quality of Life, Vehicle and Parking, Utilities and Power, Pests and Animals, Others / Miscellaneous.

borough.

```
- We choose Cleveland dot plot because with ~10 complaint buckets and 5 boroughs, a standard grouped bar chart would be wide
and cluttered.  
- A dot plot puts all categories on a shared horizontal scale (0–30%), which makes it easier to compare both **within** a borough and **across** boroughs.  

**What stands out**

- In every borough, **Noise Related** and **Vehicle and Parking** are among the top categories by share, often together making up roughly one-third of complaints.  
- **Manhattan** is particularly noise-heavy, which matches expectations for a dense, mixed-use borough with late-night activity.
- **Staten Island** shows relatively more *Street and Traffic Conditions* and *Vehicle and Parking* complaints, consistent with a more car-reliant area.  
- Buckets like *Pests and Animals* or *Utilities and Power* appear as small but visible shares everywhere; the dot plot keeps them from disappearing into an “Other” bucket.
##
To quantify how “caught up” the city is, we approximated a **daily backlog**:

> backlog(date) ≈ cumulative complaints created − cumulative complaints closed.

We plotted this as an **area chart** over the full time window.

## What is the backlog over time? is it growing or shrinking?

**What the backlog curve tells us**

- Backlog starts close to zero and **climbs steadily** throughout 2023 and 2024.  
- There are short flat spots and small dips, but no long period where the city clearly catches up; by early 2025, the estimated backlog is near the 300k mark.  
- This means that even if individual cases close in reasonable time, **new complaints** have been arriving faster than they are resolved , leaving a growing stock of open work. The backlog plot is our main evidence that the 311 system is **under sustained pressure** rather than just dealing with a one-off spike.

## How do complaints progress through the system? which types get stuck?


Next we look at what happens *after* a complaint is created.  
The alluvial (Sankey-style) diagram follows the volume of complaints from:

> **Year (2023 vs 2024) → Complaint Type (bucket) → Final Status  
> (Assigned, Closed, In Progress)**

Each band’s thickness represents the number of complaints flowing along that path.


```{r}
library(ggalluvial)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(scales)

# Prepare alluvial data
df_viz <- df_clean_final |>
  mutate(
    year = year(created_date),
    month = floor_date(created_date, "month"),
    status_clean = ifelse(status == "", NA, status)
  )

df_alluvial <- df_viz |>
  filter(!is.na(status_clean)) |>
  count(year, complaint_bucket, status_clean)

# Alluvial Plot
ggplot(
  df_alluvial,
  aes(
    axis1 = year,
    axis2 = complaint_bucket,
    axis3 = status_clean,
    y = n
  )
) +
  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = complaint_bucket), width = 1/10, alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_stratum(width = 1/10) +
  geom_label(
    stat = "stratum",
    aes(label = after_stat(stratum)),
    size = 3,
    fill = "white"
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(
    limits = c("Year", "Complaint Type", "Status"),
    expand = c(.05, .05)
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Complaint Flow: Year → Complaint Type → Final Status",
    subtitle = "How complaints evolve from originating year to type to closure state",
    y = "Number of Complaints",
    x = ""
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 13) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none",
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(face = "bold")
  )
```

**Main patterns**

- 2023 bands are thicker than 2024 simply because more months of 2023 are in the data.  
- For most buckets, the majority of complaints eventually flow into **Closed**, but the share that remains **Assigned** or **In Progress** varies by type.  
- Complaint buckets such as **Buildings and Housing** and **Sanitation and Waste** send a larger fraction of their volume into **Assigned** or **In Progress** compared to, say, **Noise** or **Vehicle and Parking**. That suggests more complex or slower workflows for physical-infrastructure issues.This plot gives a **big-picture map of the complaint lifecycle**, highlighting which categories tend to linger in the system.

## How can people contact 311? which channel is preferred when?
 How people submit complaints: ONLINE, PHONE, MOBILE, and OTHER.For each time-of-day shift (Late Night, Morning, Afternoon, Evening), we calculated each channel’s **share of monthly complaints** and plotted these as **line charts in a 2×2 facet layout**.

**Behavioural shifts we see**

- In the **Late Night** panel, ONLINE starts out dominant, but its share falls while
MOBILE rises sharply, eventually becoming comparable or higher. Night-time reporting is
increasingly app-based.  
- During **Morning** and **Afternoon**, PHONE remains important, but MOBILE’s share inches up
over the two years.  
- **Evening** shows the most balanced mix, with ONLINE still strong but MOBILE gaining
ground.

Taken together, these lines point to a **slow but clear shift towards mobile reporting**,
especially outside office hours, which has implications for how interfaces and follow-up
communication should be designed.

##  Who handles what: interactive borough–type–agency “pair” plot

To connect complaints to the agencies that act on them, we built an
**interactive Sankey diagram** with four stages:

> **Borough → Detailed Complaint Type → Agency → Status**

This is the plot we think of as a **pair-exploration tool**: users can focus on one
borough–type, type–agency, or agency–status “pair” at a time.

- Once we keep borough, detailed type (e.g. *Illegal Parking*, *Noise – Residential*),
agency (NYPD, DOT, etc.), and status, the cross-tab becomes extremely high-dimensional.  
- A static plot would either hide most detail or be unreadable.  
- Interactivity (hovering to show labels and counts, highlighting a path) allows the
reader to **drill down** without losing the full context.

**How the interactivity helps**

- Hovering on **Brooklyn → Illegal Parking** reveals a very thick band flowing to **NYPD**,
making it obvious that parking enforcement is overwhelmingly a police workload.  
- Highlighting **Noise – Residential** quickly shows which boroughs and agencies share
that burden; for example, large flows from Queens and Brooklyn again route to NYPD.  
- Smaller but meaningful flows (for example, *HEAT/HOT WATER* to the housing agency) are
easy to surface by hovering, even though they would be visually drowned out if
everything were static.

Instead of giving one fixed conclusion, this plot serves as a **navigation map for
responsibility**: it lets a reader answer questions like *“Who usually deals with this
type of complaint in my borough, and how does it tend to end?”*.

## 3.6 Where problems occur, and what type of complaints are occurring there?


We next asked **where** in the city the problems are happening.  
We focused on the top location types (e.g., *RESIDENTIAL BUILDING*, *Street/Sidewalk*,
*Store/Commercial*, *Club/Bar/Restaurant*) and the top complaint types.  
For each location, we computed the **share of its complaints** belonging to each type and
plotted this as a **heatmap** with percentages printed on the tiles.

```
- Location × complaint type is a dense matrix; heatmaps excel at summarising many
cells using colour.  
- Embedding the percentages directly gives precise values without forcing the reader to
flip back to a legend.

**Patterns by location**

- For **Residential Building/House**, complaints are heavily concentrated in a few
types — particularly *HEAT/HOT WATER* and indoor cleanliness conditions — which often
take up essentially the entire row.  
- **Street/Sidewalk** is dominated by *Illegal Parking*, *Abandoned Vehicles*, and outdoor
sanitation issues.  
- Commercial spaces (*Store/Commercial*, *Club/Bar/Restaurant*) are almost entirely noise
and cleanliness problems.

This figure supports simple, concrete statements such as:  
> “On streets and sidewalks, the story is mostly about parking and trash; inside homes,
it’s about heat, water, and living conditions.”

#### Resolution actions by location type (faceted bar charts)

We then looked at **what kind of action** is actually taken, and **where**.  
We grouped individual resolution descriptions into a handful of broader **action types**
(e.g., *Duplicate / Already Reported*, *Enforcement / Summons*, *Inspection / Investigation*,
*Referred / Transferred*, *Work Completed*).  
For each action type, we plotted a **bar chart showing the share of that action occurring in
each location type**, with one small panel per action.  
We excluded “No Issue Found” so the panels focus on cases where something concrete happened.

```{r label: action-taxonomy-location,fig-width: 12,fig-height: 8 }

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(scales)
library(stringr)
library(forcats)

# --- 1) Prep + tag resolution actions (same logic you used) ---
df3 <- df_clean_final |>
  transmute(
    location_type = str_squish(location_type),
    resolution_description = str_squish(resolution_description)
  ) |>
  filter(!is.na(location_type), location_type != "",
         !is.na(resolution_description), resolution_description != "") |>
  mutate(rd = str_to_lower(resolution_description)) |>
  mutate(action_tag = case_when(
    str_detect(rd, "inspect|inspection|investigat|observ") ~ "Inspection / Investigation",
    str_detect(rd, "no violation|unable to observe|could not.*verify") ~ "No Issue Found",
    str_detect(rd, "duplicate|already reported|previously reported") ~ "Duplicate / Already Reported",
    str_detect(rd, "summons|ticket|violation issued|enforc") ~ "Enforcement / Summons",
    str_detect(rd, "repaired|fixed|completed|work order|restored|cleaned") ~ "Work Completed",
    str_detect(rd, "referred|transfer|forwarded|sent to") ~ "Referred / Transferred",
    TRUE ~ "Other Action"
  ))
```

```{r label: action-taxonomy-location,fig-height: 7 }

# Chunk 2: plot (uses df3 from above)
top_loc <- df3 |> count(location_type, sort = TRUE) %>% slice_head(n = 10) %>% pull(location_type)

df3_f <- df3 |> filter(action_tag != "No Issue Found")

action_loc <- df3_f |>
  filter(location_type %in% top_loc) |>
  count(action_tag, location_type, name = "n") |>
  group_by(action_tag) |>
  mutate(share_within_action = n / sum(n)) |>
  ungroup()

# ---- ONLY change: sort x within each facet by share ----
action_loc <- action_loc |>
  group_by(action_tag) |>
  arrange(desc(share_within_action), .by_group = TRUE) |>
  mutate(location_type_sorted = factor(location_type, levels = unique(location_type))) |>
  ungroup()

ggplot(action_loc, aes(x = location_type_sorted, y = share_within_action, fill = action_tag)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.82, color = "white", linewidth = 0.25) +
  facet_wrap(~ action_tag, ncol = 3, scales = "free_y") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2", guide = "none") +
  labs(
    title = "Resolution Actions by Location Type (Faceted)",
    subtitle = "Excludes “No Issue Found”. Each panel shows where that action occurs most (shares sum to 100% within each action).",
    x = NULL, y = "Share within action"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 35, hjust = 1, size = 8),
    strip.text = element_text(face = "bold"),
    panel.spacing = unit(1.1, "lines"),

    # ---- ONLY change: prevent facet titles from being cut ----
    plot.margin = margin(t = 20, r = 15, b = 25, l = 15)
  )

```
- Conditioning on the action (“given that an action of type X happened, where did it
happen?”) is a different question from the previous heatmap.  
- Faceting by action keeps each panel simple and lets us scan across panels to see which
locations dominate which actions.

**What the panels reveal**

- **Duplicate / Already Reported** is almost entirely associated with *Street/Sidewalk*,
suggesting repeated reports from passers-by at the same spot.  
- **Enforcement / Summons** is heavily concentrated in public space (street, sidewalk,
above-address), aligning with ticketing and code enforcement.  
- **Inspection / Investigation** is skewed towards *RESIDENTIAL BUILDING*, which is
exactly where we’d expect inspectors to be dispatched.  
- **Work Completed** shows a mix of residential and street locations, highlighting where
city crews most often finish tangible tasks.
